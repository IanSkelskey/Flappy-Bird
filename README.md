# Flappy-Bird
An implementation of Flappy Bird using Lua language and Love2D Framework.  
This game was built with source files provided in the class:

I have tried to develop these games beyond the assignment requirements.
Here are the features that I added since submission:
- Variable Pipe Gaps
- Pause Feature
- High Sores w/ Leaderboard and Persistent Data
- Medal Award System:
  - Bronze (10 pts)
  - Silver (25 pts)
  - Gold (50 pts)
